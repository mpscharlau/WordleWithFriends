# WordleWithFriends
A desktop application to play Wordleâ„¢ with friend submitted words. Includes options to change word length and number of guesses among other things to keep the game interesting!

# Overview
Words and game settings are declared on a google sheet and are loaded into the application on startup. At application startup, you will be prompted to enter the "Sheet ID", with will direct the application to the correct google sheet. This is done so games or sessions can be played with multiple groups of people. In the Beta version, there is a text document named SheetID.txt that has the Sheet ID for you to copy. Note, progress, scores, and other data is currently not stored outside of the application; each time the application is closed and reopened, a fresh game begins.
